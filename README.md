- **2024-07-29:** Paper accepted to IPIN 2024!


## Overview

**PALMS** (Plane-based Accessible Indoor Localization Using Mobile Smartphones) is an innovative system designed for indoor global localization and relocalization using publicly available floor plans. This project leverages smartphone LiDAR capabilities to enhance accessibility for all users, including those with visual impairments.

### Features:
- Particle filter initialization using the Certainly Empty Space (CES) constraint.
- Principal orientation matching for improved accuracy.
- No need for prior environmental fingerprinting.
- Scalable and practical approach for indoor wayfinding.

## Dataset
We are currently preparing the code and dataset for public release. It will be made available soon. Stay tuned!
