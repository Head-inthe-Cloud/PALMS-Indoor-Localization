# PALMS-Indoor-Localization
A place for the code and data for the paper "PALMS: Plane-based Accessible Indoor Localization Using Mobile Smartphones" (IPIN 2024 submission) and any follow-up works.

## Overview

**PALMS** (Plane-based Accessible Localization Using Mobile Smartphones) is an innovative system designed for indoor global localization and relocalization using publicly available floor plans. This project leverages smartphone LiDAR capabilities to enhance accessibility for all users, including those with visual impairments.

### Features:
- Particle filter initialization using the Certainly Empty Space (CES) constraint.
- Principal orientation matching for improved accuracy.
- No need for prior environmental fingerprinting.
- Scalable and practical approach for indoor wayfinding.

## Dataset
We are currently preparing the dataset for public release. It will be made available soon. Stay tuned!
